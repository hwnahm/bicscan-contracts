# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn
yarn compile
yarn deploy:sepolia
```
When you re-deploy onto a chain remove the related chain folder in deployments folder.
